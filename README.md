### Features of the app

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Face Recognition</b>: This feature is meant for patients with early stage memory disorders. First, either the patient or their caretaker has to add a new person into the model. Then when the patient views that person using the app, in real time, that person’s name and relation to the patient is displayed.

  <br>
  <li>
    <b>Journal</b>: This feature helps patient note down details about objects that they would like to recall in the future. Patients with memory loss often feel more comfortable being told something by their past selves rather than someone else. Patients can add an image or audio recording along with each journal entry.

    <b>Memory game</b>: This feature is for people suffering from memory disorders. The game consists of 8 tiles having 4 pairs of matching images. The images are randomly hidden on each tile. The aim of the game is to match two tiles that have the same images. The patient has to remember which tiles contain what image in order to successfully complete the game.
